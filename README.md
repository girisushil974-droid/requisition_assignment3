Requisition System is a Python program that is used to handle requisitions in an organization. It can enable the staff to make requisitions, include items with cost-related information, automatically approve requests that are less than a specific limit and request the manager to review the requests that exceed that limit. The system also records all the requisitions and provides summary statistics like the number of approved, pending and rejected requests. This program has been created in line with the major software design principles so it could be simple, maintainable, and efficient and comments have been made throughout the program to enhance clarity and understanding.

It is one of the concepts that are used in the system and it is referred to as KISS, which means Keep It Simple, Stupid. The program makes sure that every method is carrying out one, clear cut task. One can take the example of the requisitions_details() method which is only mandated to gather item information and compute the total cost with the requisition_approval() method deciding whether a requisition is automatically approved or pending. The code is also more convenient to maintain, understand, and read because it is simple to operate. The other principle that is utilized is YAGNI, or You Aren’t Gonna Need It. The system will only have features that are necessary in the existing requisition process. It does not have any redundant features like database integration, web interfaces, or advanced reporting. The code is lightweight because it only includes the necessary functionality, and the unnecessary work is avoided.


The system is also based on the DRY principle that can be abbreviated as Don’t Repeat Yourself. Encapsulation of repetition is performed in methods to prevent repetition. As an example, the display requisition() method is used to display requisition information of all entries rather than using multiple times the print statements. Likewise, approvals logic is centralized in the responds_requisition() and requisition approval logic of requisition. This would minimize chances of making mistakes, and it would be easy to update in future. Also, the system is based on the Single Responsibility Principle because each method has its duty. The methods like requisitions details, requisition approval, respond requirements and requisition statistics are each devoted to a single task. In this manner, the separation of responsibilities simplifies the program to debug, test and extend.
#The relevance of comments to this program is that they elaborate on what each section of the code does as well as the reasons why it is being applied in the specific manner. Class-level comments are statements indicating the goal of the Requisitionsystem class and its attributes and method-level comments articulate how each method works. The inline comments make it clear on certain lines where a global counter is used to make each requisition ID unique. Commments make the code easier to read, easier to maintain as they give an explanation of the reasons behind certain decisions and assist in debugging as they make the flow of data and logic more readable.

Overall, the Requisition System demonstrates the efficient use of software design principles KISS, YAGNI, DRY and Single Responsibility Principle. The system can be maintained, scaled, and easy to use by being simple, avoiding any extraneous features, centralizing repetitive tasks, and distinctly separating roles and duties. The fact that the comprehensive comments are added also enhances clarity and makes the code accessible to make changes in the future. These practices combined together form a strong and effective system that can be used to handle requisitions within an organization.
